Abstract
########

This will be an introductory lesson to `version control`_ using the widespread distributed version control system `Git`_. We will learn enough to use git to control our files in a day-to-day workflow, and  we'll also take a look at `Github`_ web service and play around a bit with it.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over
time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows us to do things
as:

* Jump to any moment in a file past history.
* Track changes and see differences between any two moments on time.
* Long-term undo.
* Seamlessly collaborate with other people.
* And many others we'll see...

The participants are encouraged to follow the lesson typing along in their
laptops, even though we will  have computers available in the computing room.
You can follow this `installation instructions`_, ignoring the last Python part if you
want.

.. note::

    We will do some collaborative work using Github. In order to follow this
    part of the lesson you'll need a Github account, so please `create one`_. You can always remove it later if you want so.

**Targeted audience**: scientific and technical people interested having a
control over the evolution and history of changes of files and projects they work on, as well as to collaborate with others on a shared repository.

**Content level**: beginner

**Audience prerequisites**: minimal command line usage.
